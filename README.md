# Social-Network-API 

## Description
MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.
This project is a challenge to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. The project leverages Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
